As we have throughout our history as a research centre, we ensure that the reasons for applying these techniques, the methodology used to analyse data, and the conclusions drawn from our analysis are presented clearly and fully in each report. This includes publishing detailed accuracy scores for any machine learning algorithms applied as part of the research.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>This data is securely stored on a monitored server, accessible only to CASM staff, and encrypted in transit. In the event that a data breach is discovered, CASM will act swiftly to ensure that damage from this breach is minimised, including informing relevant supervisory authorities and acting to identify and resolve any security issues allowing the breach.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Demos will maintain a publicly accessible page on its website for each project, explaining the sources and character of data collected for that project, the purposes for which this data will be used, and including contact details for a designated member of staff responsible for responding to public queries about this data.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Data collected from social media sites is not stored for longer than is necessary to complete each project<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>In order to respect the rights of data controllers to maintain control of their personal data, CASM will remove from any dataset personal data pertaining to an individual who requests such deletion. This includes taking reasonable measures to ensure that content deleted from social media platforms is also removed from datasets used by CASM.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>CASM does not publish any personal data collected during its research, nor is personal data shared with third parties external to CASM or transferred out of the UK, without the explicit consent of the data subject. Any data published or shared with a third party is aggregated, anonymised or altered to prevent identification a natural person.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Where quotes from social media users are published in reports, these quotes are bowdlerised \\u2013 altered in a way which preserves meaning but prevents retroactive identification of the original post through e.g an online search. An occasional exception to this policy is observed when the user is publically known to the extent that they would not reasonably expect their social media posts to be private.
